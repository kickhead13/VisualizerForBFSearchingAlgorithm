Run Visual.py either by double-clicking it or by typing ```python Visual.py``` in console.
Than add the number of cells in the world where the path would have to be found.

One-click on a cel => a wall is added in that cell.
Three-clicks => end position added (you have to add the end position before the start position)
Two-clicks => start position
